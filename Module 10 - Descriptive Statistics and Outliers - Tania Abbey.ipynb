    "## What are statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics deal with collecting informative data, interpreting these data, and drawing conclusions about the data. Statistics are used across multiple disciplines and fuel business and policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two types of statistics\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Descriptive statistics use numeric and graphical techniques to summarize the characteristics of a set of data and to identify patterns within the dataset. Descriptive statistics also include graphically summarizing data and presenting the information in a meaningful (easy to interpret) way. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Inferential statistics use samples of data to make generalizations about a larger set of data (or a larger population). Inferential statistics use data to make estimates, decisions, and predictions about patterns and trends identified within a set of data. Inferential statistics are used to make conclusions beyond your immediate set of data. "

    "Measures of Central Tendency are estimates of what a \"typical\" value/data point is within your set of data. A measure of central tendency is a number around which an entire sample of data is spread. We can describe this central position using several statistics, including the mean (average), the median, and the mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency can be visualized with a frequency distribution (histogram). A frequency distribution is a description of values and how often each value occurs within your dataset. When you graph a frequency distribution a pattern/shape should give insight into which values occured the most/least. \n",

    "\n",
    "Several statistics are suited for data that follows a <b>normal distribution</b>. When visualized, normally distributed data lies in a symmetrical pattern (bell-shape) where the majority of the data surrounds the mean with decreasing amounts evenly distributed to the left and the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is the ideal, real-world data is not always normally distributed. Non-normal distribution is possible and there are several statistics that can still be used with non-normally distributed data. It is important to determine how your data is distributed before you embark on certain statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distribution and Measure of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the data helps to determine which measure of central tendency should be reported. Some statistics are very sensitive to non-normal distributions, while others are more resilient. Three of the most common shapes to learn are symmetric, left-skewed, and right-skewed. <b>Skew</b> is simply a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution. <b>In the below images, while not shown, the values are increasing from left to right.</b> \n",

According to this rule, basically all data values will fall within 3 SD's above or below the mean. The Empirical Rule is also known as the <font color=salmon><b>68-95-99.7 Rule</b></font> because according to this rule, your data will typically fall into the following pattern:\n",

In other words, the z-score tells you how many SD's a given value is from the mean. Values that fall above the mean will have a positive (+) z-score, while values that fall below the mean will have a negative (-) z-score. Values that are far from the mean will be considered outliers. You can define a value as an outlier if the z-score greater than +/- 3. \n",

For example, we can calculate a lower-limit -- all values falling below this limit will be considered an outlier. The <b>1.5 Rule</b> is a commonly used method for determining the upper and lower cut-off limits. According to this rule, a value is considered an outlier if it falls:\n",
